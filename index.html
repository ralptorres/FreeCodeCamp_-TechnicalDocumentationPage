            React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you
            can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to
            get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page,
            or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will
            help you get started.

            <p>
              If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an
              online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen,
              CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz. If you prefer to use your own text
              editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it
              from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime
              code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple
              demos.

              You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then
              either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a
              few dynamic widgets.

              When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags
              might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
              As your application grows, you might want to consider a more
              integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we
              recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with
              little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the
              rich React ecosystem.

            People come to React from different backgrounds and with different
            learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a
            practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.

            Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve.
            With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.

          <p>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</p>
          <p>
            First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty
            <code>div</code> tag to mark the spot where you want to display
            something with React. For example:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;!-- ... existing HTML ... --&gt;

        &lt;div id=&quot;like_button_container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- ... existing HTML ... --&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>Step 2: Add the Script Tags</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;!-- ... other HTML ... --&gt;

        &lt;!-- Load React. --&gt;
        &lt;!-- Note: when deploying, replace &quot;development.js&quot; with &quot;production.min.js&quot;. --&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js&quot; crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js&quot; crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- Load our React component. --&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;like_button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        
        &lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>Step 3: Create a React Component</p>
          <pre><code>&sol;&sol; ... the starter code you pasted ...

        const domContainer = document.querySelector(&#39;#like_button_container&#39;);
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);
        root.render(e(LikeButton));</code></pre>
          <p>Tip: Minify JavaScript for Production</p>
          <p>
            Before deploying your website to production, be mindful that
            unminified JavaScript can significantly slow down the page for your
            users. If you already minify the application scripts, your site will
            be production-ready if you ensure that the deployed HTML loads the
            versions of React ending in production.min.js:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js&quot; crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js&quot; crossorigin&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

          <p>Quickly Try JSX</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

            The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React
            team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation
            notices, will be posted there first. You can also follow the
            @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential
            if you only read the blog. Not every React release deserves its own
            blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release
            in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the
            Releases page.

          This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React.
          Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a
          separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is
          snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously
          updated.
